# Pacify

> Shell script that extracts YouTube video audio and condenses it for passive language listening

Pacify downloads YouTube audio via `youtube-dl` and condenses it for a better passive listening experience.

POSIX compliant\*
\*Require `youtube-dl`(`python`), `ffmpeg`, and `dos2unix` to be installed and in the `PATH`.
Make sure that a symlink of `python3` to `python` is made

```sh
ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
```

and that `youtube-dl` is the latest version (monthly release).

```sh
youtube-dl --version
```

This script has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, Alpine 3.13.5, FreeBSD 12.2, and OpenBSD 6.8.

## Running

```sh
chmod +x ./pacify
```

```sh
./pacify SuperTuxCart uWO5DISzMUA es
```

**Note: This video might not work on OpenBSD, try the video you want instead**

The command format is

```sh
pacify [file/directory name] [YouTube video ID] [subtitle language ID]
```

## Developing

Make sure you are using a POSIX OS and that `git` is installed and on your path then run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sirfredrick/pacify.git
```

then follow the above steps for running it.
